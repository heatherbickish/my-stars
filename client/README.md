Problem Statement:

In the vast digital landscape of social media, users often seek meaningful ways to connect, share, and explore content that aligns with their interests. However, existing platforms fail to fully engage users by creating immersive, thematic environments that tap into their fascination with space and the stars. There is a lack of social media platforms that combine the excitement of space exploration with the connective power of social interaction, creating opportunities for users to explore, share, and celebrate their interests in astronomy, astrophysics, and the wonders of the cosmos.

This web app aims to address this gap by creating an immersive social media platform where users can share content related to space, follow other users (or "stars"), and engage in community discussions centered around space exploration. The app will offer opportunities for learning, discovery, and connection with other like-minded individuals.

The challenge is to design an engaging platform that merges the wonder of space with the engaging social media experience, fostering a unique community that values discovery, connection, and the awe-inspiring beauty of the cosmos.

Why:

To inspire curiosity and wonder. Encourage users to explore the universe and develop a deeper appreciation for the cosmos. 


Concept:

Space-themed social media platform that connects users around the world through their shared passion for astronomy, space exploration, and the mysteries of the cosmos. Combining the best elements of social media with interactive celestial features
